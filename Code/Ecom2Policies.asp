      <h1>Customs</h1>
      <p>You may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, when ordering from Vubiz, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods.&nbsp; Generally, customs forms for international packages will list the value of your order&#39;s contents by product type. For instance, orders containing CDs will generally be listed in a way similar to the following example: CDs value: $xx.xx.&nbsp; Your privacy is important to us, 
      and we know that you care about how information about your order is used and shared. We would like our international customers and customers shipping products internationally to be aware that cross-border shipments are subject to being opened and inspection by customs authorities.&nbsp; Also, we may provide certain order, shipment and product information, such as titles, to our international carriers, and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and comply with local laws.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
