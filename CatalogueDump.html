                  <p>A business without ethics is a business at risk. Companies face multi-million dollar fines, criminal prosecutions and possible bankruptcy for wrongdoing, and usually behind the headlines is the story of someone who made the wrong decision, didn&#39;t report suspected wrongdoing, or failed to recognize an ethical dilemma. Employees are often expected to make decisions, sometimes acting alone or out in the field, with very few resources to help. It is important that we understand what &#39;acting ethically&#39; in the workplace means, and know how to make good decisions when there is no rulebook to help. This course will encourage you to reflect on the ethical questions we all face and give you a process for arriving at good ethical decisions.</p>

The program will show what is involved in implementing a balanced scorecard in an organization.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Recent Developments in the Balanced Scorecard (8289EN) &ndash; Since its inception, the balanced scorecard has been applied in new, innovative ways. This has spurred a significant amount of research into the scorecard, often with recommendations to expand its use in organizations and integrate it with other management systems and processes. Indeed, it has become so popular and pervasive that the term &ldquo;balanced scorecard&rdquo; is often used as a generic term for best practices around financial and non-financial measurement, and not necessarily to describe the scorecard as it was originally developed. Although there have been many new developments in the use of the balanced scorecard, there are three that are of particular interest: management processes around scorecards, building risk scorecards, and linking scorecards and scenario planning.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Balanced Scorecard Private Sector Case Study: MDS (8290EN) &ndash; In this module, we examine a specific private sector case study of scorecard implementation. MDS was a health sciences company based in Toronto, with four diverse, rapidly-growing businesses when it implemented the scorecard in the early 2000s. MDS&rsquo;s experience with the scorecard is an excellent illustration of the value scorecarding can provide even when there is no immediate or apparent need for a performance measurement and management system. Furthermore, MDS&rsquo;s implementation shows an effective way to cascade the scorecard so that it moves from one part of the organization to the entire organization. MDS used an iterative approach to its cascade rather than a simple top-down approach. MDS eventually ended up with 14 strategy maps and over 200 scorecards covering every aspect of their business.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Balanced Scorecard Public Sector Case Study: RCMP (8291EN) &ndash; In this module, we look at a public sector case study of scorecard implementation. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been a part of Canadian life almost since Confederation. With roots going back to 1873, the RCMP today is a vast organization, with a broad scope of responsibilities and thousands of employees to manage. In the late 1990s, senior management at the RCMP realized that its performance management systems were inadequate and needed a major overhaul. RCMP management felt that the balanced scorecard was the best strategic approach available. They contacted Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton, the founders of the balanced scorecard, and enlisted their help in establishing a scorecard.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Strategic Management for Your Organization Exam (8325EN)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Duration:</em></strong></p><p>4 hours</p><p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p><p>Accessible, Mobile &amp; Audio</p><p><strong><em>Module(s):</em></strong></p><p>18288EN</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>It is widely agreed that every company needs to have a policy statement on legal and ethical conduct. The Organizational Sentencing Guidelines require that a company &#39;must have taken steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all employees and other agents, e.g., by requiring participation in training Courses or by disseminating publications that explain in a practical manner what is required.&#39; Thus, if a company hopes to qualify for more lenient treatment under the Guidelines in the event of employee or corporate misconduct, having, disseminating and enforcing a Code of Conduct is essential.<br /><br />Course Summary<br /><br />This Course provides a model Code of Conduct that is a synthesis of more than 20 such policies in use by major companies today. A company that already has a Code in place can customize and use this Course to communicate that policy to its employees online &mdash; clearly an easy and effective way to communicate the message &mdash; and ensure the employees&#39; familiarity with its policy quickly and cost-effectively. Likewise, for a company that has not yet assembled or implemented a Code of Conduct, the Course provides a turn-key solution that can be put in place quickly.<br /><br />The topics covered in the Course include:<br /><br />&bull; Fairness and honesty &bull; Equal employment opportunity &bull; Employee privacy &bull; Drug and alcohol abuse &bull; Employee safety and health &bull; Unlawful harassment and discrimination &bull; Threats or violence in the workplace &bull; Emergency preparedness &bull; Conflicts of interest &bull; Insider trading &bull; Using company computer systems &bull; Using other company property &bull; Protecting confidential information &bull; Copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property &bull; Record retention and disposal &bull; Avoiding bribery and kickbacks &bull; Speaking for the company &bull; Environmental health and safety &bull; Political activities</p>

It also assists employees in identifying and pursuing their own goals. While an effective manager provides informal performance feedback on an ongoing basis, the annual performance review is a more formal process. This course focuses on the annual performance review. It will stress the importance of planning and follow-up, and provide tips and strategies for conducting successful performance reviews.

The program will show what is involved in implementing a balanced scorecard in an organization.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Recent Developments in the Balanced Scorecard (8289EN) &ndash; Since its inception, the balanced scorecard has been applied in new, innovative ways. This has spurred a significant amount of research into the scorecard, often with recommendations to expand its use in organizations and integrate it with other management systems and processes. Indeed, it has become so popular and pervasive that the term &ldquo;balanced scorecard&rdquo; is often used as a generic term for best practices around financial and non-financial measurement, and not necessarily to describe the scorecard as it was originally developed. Although there have been many new developments in the use of the balanced scorecard, there are three that are of particular interest: management processes around scorecards, building risk scorecards, and linking scorecards and scenario planning.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Balanced Scorecard Private Sector Case Study: MDS (8290EN) &ndash; In this module, we examine a specific private sector case study of scorecard implementation. MDS was a health sciences company based in Toronto, with four diverse, rapidly-growing businesses when it implemented the scorecard in the early 2000s. MDS&rsquo;s experience with the scorecard is an excellent illustration of the value scorecarding can provide even when there is no immediate or apparent need for a performance measurement and management system. Furthermore, MDS&rsquo;s implementation shows an effective way to cascade the scorecard so that it moves from one part of the organization to the entire organization. MDS used an iterative approach to its cascade rather than a simple top-down approach. MDS eventually ended up with 14 strategy maps and over 200 scorecards covering every aspect of their business.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Balanced Scorecard Public Sector Case Study: RCMP (8291EN) &ndash; In this module, we look at a public sector case study of scorecard implementation. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been a part of Canadian life almost since Confederation. With roots going back to 1873, the RCMP today is a vast organization, with a broad scope of responsibilities and thousands of employees to manage. In the late 1990s, senior management at the RCMP realized that its performance management systems were inadequate and needed a major overhaul. RCMP management felt that the balanced scorecard was the best strategic approach available. They contacted Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton, the founders of the balanced scorecard, and enlisted their help in establishing a scorecard.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Strategic Management for Your Organization Exam (8325EN)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Duration:</em></strong></p><p>4 hours</p><p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p><p>Accessible, Mobile &amp; Audio</p><p><strong><em>Module(s):</em></strong></p><p>18288EN</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>First introduced 200 years ago, the brand may become, over time, one of the most valuable assets that a company can own. That same band may also lose much of its value overnight, even more so today. By establishing and maintaining successful connections between business and consumer, the brand demonstrates its ability, and therefore its value. The many factors that not only contribute towards this connection but also detract from it are the subject of this course. The module has a test.

                  Finance basics for non-financial managers. Financial statements provide valuable information that guide business decisions. It is therefore essential that business
                  decision makers have a good understanding of financial statements and their role
                  in guiding decisions. This module presents information about the fundamentals of
                  reading and understanding financial statements. It shows how various work

These concise, learner-friendly personal development modules will help you develop a positive work environment, improve your productivity, enhance your interpersonal relationships, and find a healthy balance between work, family and self. The program addresses key topics including effective communication, coping with stress, self esteem, skills for managers, and building a healthy workplace culture.<br /><br />The examination for this course is now in an improved format that will allow you - upon exam completion - to review the questions and your answers. As before, you still have 3 attempts to pass the exam. If you already passed the exam in its previous format, you will now have 3 additional attempts to take the exam in its new format. All scores for all attempts on the exam in either format are on file and will display in the Assessment Report. Once you pass the exam in its new format, you will receive a printable online certificate, and you will no longer be able to access the exam.</p>

We will illustrate that marketing is simply a process or set of activities whose goals are to provide goods and services to individuals. We will look at the notion of individual needs as the driving force behind marketing. We will also look at the notion that the entire process requires an exchange between individuals, one that focuses on buying and selling of goods and services. We will learn that marketing is a key function in business and an important one, whether in a planned economic system or in a market-driven economic system. We will then take marketing one step further to demonstrate its various areas of specialization, such as social marketing, the marketing of individuals, organizational marketing, and real property marketing.</p>
