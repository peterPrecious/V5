The real challenge lies in gaining employee buy-in, because business results are only possible through high levels of utilization. Successful companies understand that the ability to continuously learn, unlearn and relearn is a true competitive advantage. Achieving this level of performance requires a focus on people, not technology. </p><p>Express Learning&#39;s Online Learner Readiness Assessment is a specialized web-based survey that provides vital insights to bridge the gap between e-Learning promises and tangible business results. </p><h2>5 Key Strategic Benefits</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify elusive barriers that limit people&#39;s willingness or ability to learn online </li>
        <li>Gain understanding before making large-scale investments or allocating scarce resources </li>
        <li>Base strategic decisions on valid and reliable data - not blind assumptions </li>
        <li>Improve perceptions and increase acceptance of current and future technology implementations </li>
        <li>Maximize return on your e-Learning investment </li>
      </ol><h2 align="left"><br>Why Assess Learner Readiness?</h2><p align="left"><img src="Images/utilization_cycle.jpe" align="left">Imagine the rewards of leading an organization or work unit that consistently adapts to market changes faster than the competition. When leveraged as a strategic business tool, e-Learning can provide that competitive edge. As part of your larger learning strategy, online learning offers unprecedented efficiencies in the quest for continuous learning, 
      unlearning and relearning. Achieving this degree of performance requires both effective learning resources and high levels of utilization. </p><p align="left">While quality e-Learning systems can be developed or purchased, optimal utilization is often an elusive goal. This happens because companies do not meet learner needs and/or make e-Learning implementation decisions based on inaccurate assumptions. For example, a well-intentioned organization might assume that their learners are excited about technology-delivered learning and have the necessary resources, support, skills and motivation to succeed. Months later, utilization statistics can paint a very different picture.</p><p align="left">What Does the Assessment Do?<br><img alt="Illustration - &quot;Factors that Limit E-Learning Utilization&quot;" src="Images/utilization_barriers.jpe" align="right">Express Learning&#39;s Online Learner Readiness Assessment identifies Psychological, Environmental and Technological factors that 
      limit people&#39;s Willingness or Ability to learn online.
