Two unlikely rivals — Donald Trump and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) — think they've licked the problem with their new online business schools. But do they make the grade?<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">Although Trump University was established in May 2005 primarily to impart lessons in real estate, president and co-founder Michael Sexton says surging enrolment by small-business owners — almost 250,000 at last count — has forced it to build the entrepreneurship portion of its curriculum. About 60 courses pertain to business owners, and Sexton aims to offer 100 by the end of 2007: &quot;Our long-term goal is to be the largest provider of small-business education in the world.&quot;<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">The Donald himself makes numerous appearances in course-related Web videos, including an introductory segment in which he proclaims in his trademarked fashion: &quot;I didn't want to put my name on anything to do with education unless it was going to be the best.&quot;<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">Faculty include professors recruited from major U.S. universities such as Northwestern, Columbia and Dartmouth, plus Trump's pals from &quot;the school of hard knocks.&quot; As for the teaching philosophy, it's hands-on; for instance, you'll analyze potential competitors in &quot;Accelerate Your Business Growth,&quot; and develop a turnaround plan for a failing restaurant in &quot;Build a Powerful Marketing Strategy.&quot; While teaching assistants provide feedback on assignments, you won't receive credits or degrees.<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">&quot;We didn't want an academic ivory tower,&quot; says Sexton. &quot;Everything we teach is grounded in practical application, and that cannot be judged.&quot; So, if you want something to show for your hard work, you'll have to visit the campus e-store, where you can buy all manner of Trump University memorabilia, including a baseball cap for US$21.95 and a golf shirt for US$39.95. Or you can just settle for the bill, which will range from US$150 for a basic click-through course with two or three assignments to US$12,000 for a &quot;mastery&quot; course, an instructor-led multimedia program that includes live teleseminars and a business coach.<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">A more affordable option is the CFIB's online Small Business Management Certificate program (<a title="http://vubiz.com/V5/Code/SPC_SBMC_Default.asp
blocked::http://vubiz.com/V5/Code/SPC_SBMC_Default.asp" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none" href="http://vubiz.com/V5/Code/SPC_SBMC_Default.asp"><font title="http://vubiz.com/V5/Code/SPC_SBMC_Default.asp

Launched in October, the 20-hour program comprises a series of click-through, text-based courses on topics such as financing, strategic management and international trade. Although it's far more sedate than Trump U, the price is right: $200 for three students.<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">CFIB president Catherine Swift says the organization wanted to take the guesswork out of course selection, so it tailored the curriculum to the most common learning needs of Canadian entrepreneurs.<br>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">Unlike at Trump U, there'll be no guessing how much you learned at CFIB school, which does test and grade its students. Achieve a 70% course average, and you get to print out a Small Business Management Certificate you can hang on your wall. It might be less functional than a baseball cap, but it might be more meaningful.</span></font></td>
