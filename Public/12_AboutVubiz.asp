      <blockquote>
        <p class="c2">Vubiz commenced operations in late 1995 as a not-for-profit company, called the Learning Institute for Small and Medium Sized Enterprise (LISME). It was founded by John Bulloch, Founder and Past President of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB). In 2000, the company was incorporated and changed its legal name to Vubiz Ltd. </p>

      <p class="c1">Vubiz Today </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="c2">Vubiz's primary area of business is as an e-learning solutions provider, and as such, has made a significant e-learning impact on a national and international scale. Jim Rapino, Vubiz President and CEO, is a leading learning professional and our Senior VP and CTO, Peter Bulloch, is a solid technical professional. This combination enables us to cater to varied learning environments in Canada, the US and globally. We have demonstrated tremendous success in developing and delivering high quality web-based courseware, delivery systems and other related services for some of our 120+ clients, affording us an extremely diversified presence within our target markets: SMEs, Associations, Corporations, Government, Training Institutions and the public at large. Vubiz excels in soft skills content, and packages its products via the Vubiz Platform, Strategic Partner Platforms and CD ROM - Vubiz or Private Label. We also distribute product via Direct and Indirect Sales through VARs, Corporate LANS, E-commerce and ASP. Our major work with companies involves off-the-shelf offerings in many varied topics, custom courseware production combined with special online services, plus hosting and distribution of content in several languages. Although many companies in this industry have a very narrow niche in terms of either content production or platform technology, Vubiz is a full service e-learning company that produces content using professional instructional designers and its own authoring tool, and has its own software platform for distribution. All of our contracts include full program evaluation and customer support. </p>
